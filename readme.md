# qitaab

I am currently having a hard time at work. Any task that I am assigned takes forever + about a day to complete. The forever part of this is because of lack of documentation of the project that I'm wokring on. I need to go through a lot of stuff to really understand what is going on and what I'm supposed to do. The "about a day" part is because I'm slow and inexperienced, so it takes some time for me to get hang of things.

I reckon that there would be at least thousands of entry level devs like me (if not more) who would be struggling to row their boat through something similar, where the project that they are working on is not documented very well or they are not savvy enough to understand what the code does just by looking at it once.

The simple solution to this problem would be to maintain documentation for everything.

Hence, this tool. So, this is a documentation tool.

But why not other documentation tools that already exist?
The way of representing information of other documentation tools just does not seem to be natural to me. While reading docs for some library or service, I always think that there should be a better way to represent documented information, which will be much more intuitive than pressing next and previous buttons, browsing through a list of bullet points to get information on the thing that you were looking for.

Hence, this tool. So, this is a documentation tool that will represent information in a different way. A more "natural" way in my opinion.

Let's see how far it goes!

P.S. qitaab is Urdu/Hindi word for book. A book is supposed to enlighten you and spread information. I see this as the modern day "qitaab" for software documentation.
