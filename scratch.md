### what are the things that we may need to track?
~~- name~~
~~- image~~
~~- states~~
~~- api calls~~
~~- description~~
~~- passed props~~
~~- props being used~~
~~- file that the component is defined in~~


~~name is plain text~~
~~image is regular image, just the source url~~
states - can have details like type
api calls - can have details like slug, authenticated or not, etc.
description - plain text for now (could be great if markdown can be supported)
passed props and props being used - can have details like type
file that the component is defined in - can have details like directory in which the file lies
