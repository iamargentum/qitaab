## why did i start the project in react?
    it was getting more and more difficult to really do the project in plain javascript

    i saw something coming, the implementation of which would be really bad in javascript with its imperative approach

## why did i start the project in svelte and then purge it and then start with react again?
    it will take me some more time to really understand what svelte is

## what needs to be done now?
    1. integrate tailwindcss
    2. create a landing page
    3. create a node creation page
    4. create a network-view page (i hope i get the power to do it. i don't really know how i will do it)
    5. let's implement the things listed above and then get back, shall we?
